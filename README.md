# FastAPI with Docker CRUD

This is a sample crud app built by following the tutorial here:
https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-crud/

I customized the project a bit:
- Added a `Makefile` for easy execution/documentation of all project tasks.
- Used `pdm` to manage the dependencies of the python project.
